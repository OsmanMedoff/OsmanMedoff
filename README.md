Hi, I'm Osman Medoff! 
I'm a programmer currently learning to use Ionic/Angular. I've had 5 years of experience with Unity (game-engine) and overtime have learnt general C# knowledge. I am planning to become a game developer as a future career, but I may switch to something different. Nevertheless it will be about programming, because that's what I have passion for. :)
